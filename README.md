## User Experience (UX)

- ### User Stories

  - #### First Time Visitor Goals

    1. As a first time visitor, I want to have a enjoyable experience playing the sites game.
    2. As a first time visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate through the website.
    3. As a first time visitor, I want to have interactive experience on the site.

  - #### Returning Visitor Goals

    1. As a returning visitor, I want to have replayability of the game.
    2. As a returning visitor, I want to be able to challenge my previous scores and better them.

- ### Design

  - #### Colour Scheme

    - The two main colours used in this project are white and medium grey. I wanted to keep the colour scheme as simple as possible and have the main focus on the game.

  - #### Typography

    - The font that was used for the heading was 'Bebas-Neue' with a fallback of sans-serif since it has a very sharp and bold look to it. It suits the theme of the website since it is quite a simple looking website and the title is clear and readable for the name of the game.
    - The font that was used for the body was 'Oswald' with a fallback of sans-serif. Again the purpose behind this is that the site has a clean and simple look to it, so the text needs to be readable, especially with the scores updating. It isn't as bold as the header font so it doesn't distract the user from the heading.

  - #### Imagery

    - There was not many imagery used in this project, how ever I used icons from [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com) for the hand images for the choices of the game. I decided to go for the clean and black font since its easily readable and suits the colour scheme of the site. I tried the yellow and outlined icons but they seemed out of place.

## Features

- #### User Choice Selection
  - Added features to the game area where the users can select what choice they want to play against the computer. The icons grow when the user hovers over them and eases in and out. Also the mouse icon changes to notify the user that they are clickable.

- #### Reveal Area
  - Added the reveal area to show what the user has picked and what the computer has picked. The icons are much bigger than the choice icons, so that they are easily seen when playing. The icons match the icons in the choice area.

- #### Score Area
  - Added score area below the game, to show the user the current score of the game. The user can see the win, draw and lose scores increment up as they play to keep track of how they are doing.
